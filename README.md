# This script is to create your own keycapsticker  

## Create the data

After I setup the layout for my new kyria, I found this layout editor:

http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/

I set it up for my needs like this: 

http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/5d2d9c3f3a3bf8220f4edd40e607096d

Then I exported the layout into json and let chatgpt create the skeleton of this script.

Now I can generate my own keycap sticker.

## Usage
```bash
npm i 
node kcs.js < layout.json > keycap.html
```

open the keycap.html in your favorite browser and print it out. 

Before printing, disable all scaling and adjustments of your printersetup.  

## create the keycaps
